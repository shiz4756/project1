                <p class="p1" id="p1">
                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspLijiang has a long history. It is the ancient birthplace of dongba culture. The naxi people of this city still live
                    in this culture. The city's history can be traced back to the warring states period (475-221 BC) in China. Today, the city is primarily
                    known as a scenic garden resort, with lush green valleys surrounded by snow-capped peaks.

                <p id="p1">
                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspLijiang is at a crossroads. It is one of the few towns where the architectural styles of northern and southern China 
                    can be found. It marks the place where the Yangtze river leaves Tibet to become the main artery of Chinese commerce and culture. The Yangtze 
                    river flows from lijiang into sichuan province, through chongqing, to the huge three gorges dam, to wuhan and nanjing, and to the east China 
                    sea near Shanghai.

                <p id="p1">
                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThere is a canal in lijiang. The city's ancient water distribution system was complex, but still very practical. The canal 
                    adds to the beauty of the city.
                </p>
                <p id="p1">
                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIn addition to the large naxi ethnic group, lijiang is also inhabited by yi, li, pumi, bai, Dai, miao, zhuang, Tibetan and 
                    hui ethnic groups. In 1997, UNESCO listed lijiang as one of the world's major cultural heritage sites.

                    one of the two ancient cities that have successfully declared the world cultural heritage with the entire ancient city One.
                </p>

                <p id="p1">
                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspLijiang Old Town is an ancient city without walls. The smooth and clean bluestone roads, houses made of clay structures, and the 
                    ubiquitous small bridges and flowing water form a dynamic landscape with the crowds that come and go, making people feel not rush. More quiet and relaxing.

                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe most suitable place to take a panoramic view of Lijiang Old Town is at Wenchang Palace, where the brightly lit night of Lijiang can be photographed.

                <p class="p1" id="p1">
                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspLugu Lake is located 200 kilometers (about 124 miles) from the center of Lijiang, at the junction of Ninglang County in Yunnan Province 
                    and Yanyuan County in Sichuan Province. It is like a beautiful pearl, shining in the mountains of the northwestern Yunnan plateau.

                <p id="p1">
                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe lake is horseshoe shaped-long from north to south and narrow from east to west. The scenery of the lake is constantly changing throughout 
                    the day. The morning fog mixes with the rays of the rising sun, giving the lake an orange glow covered by fog. When the sun casts the shadows of the mountains on 
                    the water, the lake shows a verdant color. When the sun sets in the evening, the lake level is quiet and dark green, and when the night comes, the lake level is 
                    quiet. The breeze was blowing and the water was rippling.
                </p>
                <p id="p1">
                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThere are five islands on the lake. They vary in size, like green boats floating on the water. Heiwawu Island, Liwubi Island and Lige Island 
                    are the most famous. Heiwaya Island is located in the center of the lake, where various birds live. The smallest island on the lake is Nissi, a rectangular rock 
                    covered with shrubs and moss. In addition to the five islands, there are three peninsulas and an island. There is a path paved with small stones leading to the 
                    seawall on the coast.
                </p>
                <p id="p1">
                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspMystery and charm surround this lake, partly because it used to be an unspoilt place and still retains most of its natural beauty, but mainly 
                    because the Mosuo people living there formed a matriarchal society. No marriage. A man stays at a woman's house as a partner and is called "Axia". This intimate 
                    relationship lasts as long as it lasts. The children were brought up by women, using their mother ’s surname. The family is made up of members of matrilineal 
                    relatives. Women's production and management have a dominant position in society, forming a modern "women's kingdom", which adds a sense of mystery to this place.
