                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe Great Wall was not built in a time, it’s the efforts of thousands of Chinese in many 
                    dynasties. These walls stretch over many thousands of miles in total, and stand in various stages of disrepair 
                    or restoration. The origin of the wall can date back to 7th century BC when there were many ducal states fighting 
                    against each other. Each ducal states or kingdoms built their own city walls to protect themselves. In 221 BC, the 
                    King of Qin Kingdom conquered the other states and unified the whole country as Qin Empire, and the King became 
                    Emperor Qinshihuang (First Emperor of the Qin Dynasty). Emperor Qinshihuang ordered to link all city walls in 
                    different places up, and the Qin Dynasty Great Wall came into being. Little of the Qing Dynasty wall remains. Later 
                    dynasties sometimes restored and rebuilt along a line established by their predecessors.

                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe Han Dyansty (206 BC-220 AD) was the second climax to repair the wall since it’s threatened 
                    by the Huns in the north at that time. The wall was reconstructed and maintained through the dynasty for almost 400 
                    years. The later Sui, Northern and Jin dynasties all repaired, restored or expanded sections of the wall to defend 
                    themselves. The Great Wall was revived again during the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) following the collapse of Mongolian 
                    Yuan Dynasty. The Ming adopted a new strategy to keep Mongolians out by constructing walls along the northern border 
                    of China. The Ming construction was stronger and more elaborate due to the use of stone and bricks instead of rammed 
                    earth. Sections near the Ming capital of Beijing were especially strong. When the Ming was defeated by Manchurian in 
                    1644, the Great Wall lost its function as defense project as the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) controlled both the outside 
                    and inside of the wall. Most of sections of the Great Wall we see today were from the Ming Dynasty.

                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe Great Wall is a potent Chinese cultural icon. The relics of the Great Wall and its fortresses 
                    and watchtowers show us China's culture of national pride, grand projects, and determined resistance, but also its 
                    culture of extravagant architecture and art. There are many paintings, poems, operas, stories, and legends inspired by 
                    the Great Wall.

                <p id="p1">
                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspNowadays the Great Wall exemplifies a culture of preserving cultural heritage, and greater openness 
                    to the outside world, with the Great Wall becoming China's greatest tourist attraction. Great Wall paintings, embroidery, 
                    décor, photography, and post cards are a modern Chinese art form.

                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe Great Wall is a powerful symbol. It represents the unification of China, because it was linked 
                    together as China was unified for the first time in the Qin Dynasty (221–206 BC). It represents the awesome ability of the 
                    Chinese to work together for the good of the country.

                <p id="p1">
                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWhile it represents unity on the China side, the Great Wall represents separation from the rest of the 
                    world on the other, along with the lengths a nation will go to preserve their culture and keep invaders out.

                <p id="p1">
                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIronically, as a tourist attraction, the Great Wall is now helping to draw millions of outsiders in to 
                    China to experience Chinese culture. China welcomes you!

                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis story of love and devotion was set in the time of the Qin Dynasty Great Wall.

                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA girl named Meng Jiangnv saved a man named Fan Xiliang. They fell in love with each other and got married. 
                    Unfortunately, Fan Xiliang was found, captured, and returned to forced labor at a Great Wall construction site.

                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspMeng Jiangnv waited day and night for her husband. Winter came, but Fan Xiliang failed to return. Meng Jiangnv 
                    sewed some warm clothes to take her husband. She arrived at the construction site, but Fan Xiliang was nowhere to be found. She was 
                    then informed that Fan Xiliang had died and his body was built into the Great Wall.

                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspMeng Jiangnv stayed by the wall and wept for days and nights. Deeply moved by the girl's bitter weeping, the Great 
                    Wall collapsed and she finally found Fan Xiliang’s body.

                <p class="p1" id="p1">
                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspDuring the construction of the Ming Dynasty Great Wall, Emperor Yongle (reigned 1402–1424) ordered a general named 
                    Cai Kai to build the Huanghuacheng Section of the Great Wall. Cai Kai employed meticulous quality control and spent several arduous years 
                    to finish this task. However, he was hastily beheaded when the ministry of war got wind of his extravagance.

                <p id="p1">
                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe emperor realized he had wronged Cai Kai after an official found the wall to be extraordinarily solid and steep. Later, 
                    the emperor built a tomb for Cai Kai to commemorate his great contribution and named this section "Metal Soup" Great Wall, due to its solidity.
