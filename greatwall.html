                <p class="p1" id="p1">
                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe Great Wall was not built overnight. It was the result of the joint efforts of thousands of people 
                    throughout China. These city walls stretch for thousands of miles in total and are at various stages of disrepair or repair. 
                    The origin of the Great Wall dates back to the 7th century BC, when many vassal states fought against each other. Each duke 
                    country or kingdom has built its own walls to protect itself. In 221 BC, the King of the Qin State conquered other countries, 
                    unified the whole country, became the Emperor of the Qin State, and became the Emperor Qin (the first emperor of the Qin Dynasty). 
                    Qin Shihuang ordered the city walls to be connected, and the Great Wall of the Qin Dynasty appeared. Few city walls remained in 
                    the Qing Dynasty. Later dynasties sometimes repaired and rebuilt along the lines established by their predecessors.

                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe Han Dynasty (206 BC-220 AD) was the second climax of the restoration of the Great Wall, because the Great 
                    Wall was threatened by the northern Huns at that time. The Great Wall has been reconstructed and maintained for nearly 400 years. 
                    Later the Sui, Northern and Jin dynasties repaired, restored or expanded the Great Wall to protect themselves. The Great Wall was 
                    rebuilt after the fall of the Yuan Dynasty in the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644). The Ming Dynasty adopted a new strategy to block Mongolians 
                    by building city walls on the northern border of China. The Ming dynasty architecture was stronger and more refined, because stones and 
                    bricks were used instead of rammed earth. The section near the capital of the Ming Dynasty, Beijing, is particularly strong. When the 
                    Ming Dynasty was defeated by the Manchus in 1644, the Great Wall lost its defensive function because the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) 
                    controlled the inside and outside of the Great Wall. Most of the Great Wall we see today are from the Ming Dynasty.

                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe Great Wall is a powerful symbol of Chinese culture. The remains of the Great Wall and its fortress and watchtower 
                    show us China's national pride, magnificent engineering and firm resistance, but also its luxurious architecture and artistic culture. The 
                    Great Wall inspired many paintings, poetry, operas, stories and legends.

                <p id="p1">
                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspToday, the Great Wall is a model for protecting cultural heritage and expanding its opening up. The Great Wall has become 
                    China's largest tourist attraction. Great Wall painting, embroidery, decoration, photography and postcards are a modern Chinese art form.

                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe Great Wall is a powerful symbol. It represents the reunification of China, because it was linked when China was first 
                    reunified in the Qin Dynasty (221-206 BC). It represents the extraordinary ability of the Chinese to work together for the benefit of the country.

                <p id="p1">
                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOn the one hand, the Great Wall represents the unity of China, on the other hand, the Great Wall represents the isolation from 
                    the rest of the world, and the efforts a country has made to protect its culture and resist invaders.

                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                    Ironically, as a tourist attraction, the Great Wall is now helping to attract millions of foreigners to China to experience Chinese culture. China welcomes you!

                <p class="p1" id="p1">
                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis story of love and devotion was established during the qin Great Wall.

                <p id="p1">
                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA girl named Meng Jiangnv saved a man named Fan Xiliang. They fell in love with each other and got married. 
                    Unfortunately, Fan Xiliang was found, captured, and returned to forced labor at a Great Wall construction site.

                <p id="p1">
                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspMeng Jiangnv waited for her husband day and night. Winter came, but Fan Xiliang did not return. The Meng Jiang woman 
                    sewed some warm clothes for her husband. When she arrived at the construction site, Fan Xiliang was not seen. She learned that Fan Xiliang 
                    was dead and his body was buried in the Great Wall.

                <p id="p1">
                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspMeng Jiangnv stayed by the wall and cried day and night. Deeply moved by the girl's bitter weeping, the Great 
                    Wall collapsed and she finally found Fan Xiliang's body.

                <div><img id="img1" alt="the Great Wall 4" src="greatwall/wall5.jpg"></div>
                <p class="p1" id="p1">
                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWhen the Great Wall was built in the Ming Dynasty, Emperor Yongle (reigned 1402-1424) ordered a general named 
                    Cai Kai to build the Huanghua City Great Wall. Cai Kai is meticulous in quality control and completed this task after several years 
                    of hard work. However, when the Ministry of War heard of his profligate news, he was hurriedly beheaded.
                </p>
                <p id="p1">
                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAfter an official found the wall to be particularly strong and steep, the emperor realized that he had faulted 
                    Cai Kai by mistake. Later, the emperor built a mausoleum for Cai Kai to commemorate his great contributions, and named this section 
                    of the Great Wall "Metal Soup" because it was strong.
