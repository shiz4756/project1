                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe oldest irrigation system in the world is in China. It is called Dujiangyan and is the only 
                    ancient non-dam irrigation system that has survived. Dujiangyan is a miracle of science and engineering in China, 
                    built more than 2200 years ago. The system is still used to irrigate 66,700 hectares of farmland, drain water, and 
                    provide water for more than 50 cities in Sichuan Province.

                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspDujiangyan is the wisdom of Li Bing, a local official in Sichuan Province, more than 2000 years 
                    ago. It appeared to respond to frequent floods of the Minjiang River, a tributary of the Yangtze River. Li Bing and 
                    his son found that the river flooding was caused by melted water from the mountains breaking down the bank of the slowly 
                    flowing river below. Building a dam was impossible because Li Bing was told to open waterways for warships. Therefore, 
                    Li Bing’s solution was to construct an artificial dike to transfer part of the water to another area, and then dig a ditch 
                    in Yulai Mountain to transport the excess water to the arid Chengdu Plain.

                    about it. The spirit of the people, celebrities gathered here. Due to the existence of dujiangyan, all the ancient sages 
                    had their merits in water control: li bing and his son in the warring states period, wen weng in the han dynasty, zhuge 
                    liang in The Three Kingdoms, and later gao jian, ji dangpu and ding baozhen were all outstanding officials in the dynasties, 
                    and were all imprinted on the weir road for their merits in water control. Zhang daoling, peng chunxian equal to qingcheng 
                    mountain will carry forward Taoist culture. Zhang daoling was respected as zhang tianshi, which shows his position in Taoism. 
                    Under the influence of progressive intellectuals huang zunxian and kang youwei, dong xiangqin, a native poet in the qing dynasty,

                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe famous dam-free water diversion project, Dujiangyan, has lasted for more than 2260 years. Its sustainable 
                    use of water treatment has high scientific value. The main project of Dujiangyan, the fish mouth, the flying sand weir and the 
                    treasure bottle mouth, is well-conceived. Since its creation, it has been repaired many times, but each repair has inherited this 
                    form of engineering hub layout, which shows that the planning more than 2000 years ago is simply Called "perfect". Yuzui, historically 
                    known as Dujiangyuzui, also known as water-dividing fishzui, has turned the water of the Minjiang River into two parts: Neijiang and 
                    Waijiang: Waijiang is the mainstream of the Minjiang River and flows to the Yangtze River; Neijiang water enters the Chengdu Plain 
                    through the Aquarium. "Deep beach, low weir", the "low" of Feisha weir was carefully observed and calculated by the ancients. Excess 
                    water can overflow from the top of the weir into the outer river to ensure the safety of the irrigation area. A section of the Inner 
                    River in front of the treasure bottle mouth was cut into a curve to achieve "front-side water intake and side-side sand drainage",
                    which not only achieved a sufficient amount of water, but also avoided channel siltation. It is precisely because of Dujiangyan, 
                    which is in line with scientific principles, that the country of Tianfu, which "floods and dries from people, and does not know famine", 
                    was created.
